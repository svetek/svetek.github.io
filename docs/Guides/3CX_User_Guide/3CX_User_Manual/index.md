## How to Setup & Make Changes to Your Voicemail

Your phone system is a software product from a vendor called 3cx. Here is a link to their website  www.3cx.com.  One of the first, important steps for all new users to do when they are added to the communication system is to setup their voicemail greeting and also create a simple recording of their name called a self ID.  This is needed for the “Dial by Name” function on the system for outside callers to locate your extension. If you don’t complete this step then outside callers will not be able to look you up in the Dial by Name directory.

Follow these steps:  

- Dial the voicemail extension listed on your welcome email. In most cases this will be 999. If you have a physical phone on your desktop, you can press the voicemail or message button.
- When prompted, enter your PIN followed by #.
- To set up voicemail and self ID, dial “9” then a new list of options will be announced.
- Press “5” to change your self-identification message that will list your name in the Dial by Name directory. Say your First Name and Last name when prompted.
- To record a new message for your voicemail dial 0, then follow the prompts and press # when done, then press 0 to save and exit. Press # to return to the voicemail menu.
- To record a new greeting press 8, then 0 to record new greeting followed by # 0 to save and a # to exit the menu.
- If you don’t like your PIN, you can change it by pressing 7 and follow the prompts to change it.
- When done, press # to return to the main menu or simply hang up.

## 3CX Managing your queue status
### 3CX Web Client / Desktop App 
The user can select “Login to queue” and “Logout from queue” from the user profile photo. The option will be applied to all the queues the user is a member of.  
![img.png](images/3CX_queue_login_webapp.png)  

An agent can be a member of more than one queue and the agent can choose which queues they will be a member of. In this case, the panel can be used to select which individual queues an agent will be logged in to.  

![img.png](images/3CX_queue_login_webapp_selective.png)

Use the 3CX Web Client/ Desktop App to log in and out of individual queues:

1. Go to “**Panel**”.
2. Select one of the available queues.
3. Click on the “**Logged in / Logged out**” indicator below the agent's name to login or logout the agent from this queue.

**Queue managers  can login / logout On behalf of**
The explicit login and logout can also be done on behalf of the agent, by the assigned queue manager(s). Agents who are not queue managers can only log themselves in and out of queues.

### Dial codes  
Some IP Phones do not have BLF keys. In this case, agents will need to use dial codes, which are provided on the PBX to log in and out of queues. The dial codes are defined in the 3CX Management Console and configured by the PBX Administrator.  

> **LOGGING IN & LOGGING OUT OF THE QUEUE**
>
> By default, the dialing code to log IN to a queue is: *62  
> By default, the dialing code to log OUT of a queue is: *63  
{: .important}
 
These can be modified by the PBX Administrator, so it is best to verify the dial codes with the Administrator before using these.  
  
### 3CX Mobile app
